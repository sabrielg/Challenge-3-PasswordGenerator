# Challenge-3-PasswordGenerator

## Description
- It is challenging to come up with new passwords over and over again. Creating a random password generator is a useful way to ensure passwords are secure and frees the user from having to re-use passwords or come up with new ones ove and over.
- I was motivated to create a random password generator for users to create secure passwords.
- Using almost 100% JavaScript helped me learn how to use functions, for loops, arrays, and other elements. 
## Usage
This password generator prompts the user to pick how many characters they would like their password to be (between 8-128), asks if they would like special characters, uppcase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. It collects all of that information in a larger array that then generates a password visible for the user.
